Hiring Team
Millennium Corporation
1400 Crystal Drive, Suite 400
Arlington, VA 22202

Dear Hiring Team,

Millennium's position as the DoD's largest contracted red team organization — supporting 8 of 12 NSA-certified DoD Red Teams through your MTS Advantage contract with Naval Information Warfare Center Atlantic — reflects exactly the scale and mission seriousness I've been working toward. I am applying for the Red Team Security Engineer III position at your Virginia Beach location.

My background aligns directly with what this role requires. As Technical Director for Cyber Aggressor at U.S. Space Force, I established the DoD Certified Red Team (DCRT) compliance framework for Space Force aggressor operations, developed and deployed the first Space Force cyber aggressor platform, and led Moonlight Defender 1 and 2 — the first live-satellite adversarial exercises integrating on-orbit systems and ICS/OT networks. That work trained 80+ operators and became the institutional model for Space Force adversarial testing. The platform-centric assessment methodology I built for live satellite systems translates directly to naval weapon system cyber assessments. I hold OSCE3 (combining OSEP, OSED, and OSWE), GXPN, and OSCP, alongside active TS/SCI with Polygraph — certifications and access that enable immediate contribution to your classified mission portfolio.

What draws me specifically to Millennium is the combination of mission depth and operator development investment. The k>fivefour training platform and your commitment to developing the next generation of certified operators reflects how I've approached my own career: as Teaching Assistant at SANS Institute, I've been mentoring professionals pursuing advanced certifications while actively developing their operational tradecraft. Joining the organization that defines NSA-certified red teaming in the DoD — and contributing to the expansion that the Markon Solutions partnership represents — is the right next mission.

Thank you for considering my application. I welcome the opportunity to discuss how my red team leadership experience, ICS/OT assessment background, and custom tooling capability can contribute to Millennium's NIWC Atlantic mission and broader DoD portfolio. I am available at your convenience and ready to relocate to Virginia Beach.

Sincerely,

Eric J. Lu

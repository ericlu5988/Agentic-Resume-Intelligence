    "Highlight Type 1 Cryptography expertise as a direct match for UKNDS requirements."
  ],
  "strategic_recommendation": "The candidate remains a NO-GO for the UKG-specific Security Controller role due to the terminal citizenship and clearance requirements. However, the 'Strategic Bridging' performed during tailoring reveals an exceptional fit for Palantir's high-tier private security, offensive research, or international defense deployments where field-hardened leadership and 'Adversary Logic' are more valuable than specific government vetting. Recommend pivoting the application to Palantir's 'Global Security' or 'FDE' divisions."

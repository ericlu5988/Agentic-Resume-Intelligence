## Company Profile

Millennium Corporation was founded in 2004 by Army veteran Kevin Jennings and Navy veteran Cedric Henry, who met at the Army's Command & General Staff College in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas [1]. Headquartered at 1400 Crystal Drive, Suite 400, Arlington, VA 22202, the company has grown from a small startup into a 450+ employee federal cybersecurity contractor operating across 41 states with major hubs in Arlington, VA; Huntsville, AL; Wichita, KS; Charleston, SC; and New Orleans, LA [1, 3].

The company celebrated its 20th anniversary in April 2024 and has received eight Virginia Fantastic 50 awards and multiple Inc 500/5000 awards, including recognition as the Fastest Growing Company in Virginia in 2014 [3, 4]. They are a private company — no public stock, investor-driven pressure.

Millennium describes itself as a "cyber-solutions company specializing in adversarial threat emulation, test and evaluation, and intelligence support operations for the Department of Defense (DoD) and other federal agencies" [4]. Their stated differentiator is scale in DoD red teaming: they support 8 out of 12 DoD Certified Red Teams and maintain the largest contingent of contracted red team operators in DoD — over 75 experts dedicated to red team operations [3].

Millennium is now part of the **Markon Solutions family of companies** [2]. Markon Solutions, founded in 2007 and headquartered in Falls Church, VA, is a federal consulting firm serving intelligence, defense, and civilian agencies with services including cybersecurity, agile program management, and critical infrastructure consulting [9]. The Markon/Millennium relationship is described in the job posting as Millennium being "part of the Markon Solutions family of companies — a network of specialized organizations united in support of critical national security missions." This is a strategic partnership, not a full acquisition, designed to expand operational reach and expert bench depth.

## Leadership

**Kevin Jennings — CEO and Co-Founder**: Army veteran, has led Millennium since its 2004 founding. Recognized as Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year [5]. Sets strategic direction and has overseen expansion from DoD red team operations into enterprise cybersecurity, commercial red team training (k>fivefour), and digital footprint analysis (ShadowView).

**Cedric Henry — Co-Founder**: Navy veteran. As a Navy vet co-founder, his background likely influences the company's strong relationship with naval customers including NIWC Atlantic [5].

**Bruce Goldstein — VP Business Development**: Named in leadership profiles [6]. Drives BD strategy, which is relevant to the role's listed "Business Development" responsibility.

Team structure for red team operations includes a "Black Ops Team" — an elite unit of cyber operators and software developers focused on developing advanced adversarial capabilities and custom toolsets for complex high-end missions [7].

## Security & Compliance Posture

Millennium's core business IS security — specifically offensive security. Their compliance posture is directly relevant to this role:

- **NSA-Certified DoD Red Teams**: Millennium supports the bulk of NSA-certified red teams in the DoD. This is the primary accreditation governing the role's responsibilities [7].
- **DoD Certified Red Team (DCRT) standards**: Referenced explicitly in job posting and company documentation as the compliance framework for aggressor operations.
- **CAGE Code / DUNS**: CAGE 3VQP8, DUNS 144506081, UEI VQEKGSSU7FG3 — active DoD contractor [7].
- **MTS Advantage IDIQ**: Joint venture between Millennium and TIME Systems LLC, which won a $99.9M IDIQ for cyber red team services and vulnerability testing for the U.S. Navy's Naval Information Warfare Center Atlantic (NIWC Atlantic), with performance running through July 2026 [10, 11].
- **NIWC Atlantic Follow-on**: Millennium also won a five-year task order worth up to $177M to help Naval Information Warfare Systems Command manage enterprise system life cycles for the U.S. Navy [4].
- **MAXISIQ Acquisition (May 2023)**: Acquired MAXISIQ's INGRESSIVE Business division, adding security vulnerability assessments, penetration testing, and red team exercises to their portfolio, specifically with federal government customers [12].

The company's security posture is inherently strong — they operate classified red team environments and maintain the personnel security and facility clearances necessary to execute NSA-certified missions.

## Culture & Sentiment

Glassdoor and Indeed reviews reflect a mixed-but-generally-positive picture [13, 14]:

**Positive signals:**
- "Family-like feel" and "amazing company culture" cited frequently
- Strong leadership, people-first atmosphere for operators
- Work-life balance rated positively by technical staff
- Mentorship culture — the role itself involves operator mentoring, which aligns with internal culture norms
- Remote/flexible work cited for some roles (not applicable to this TS/SCI on-site role)

**Negative signals:**
- Limited vacation/holiday time and no paid parental leave noted
- Some 2024 reviews mention "low morale" and executive communication challenges
- Compensation competitive but some reviews note lower pay versus large prime contractors (Booz Allen, SAIC, Leidos)
- Limited career advancement pathway in some cases

**Context for this role**: Senior red team operators at Millennium are the core product. The company's reputation and business model depend on retaining elite operators. The negative signals (morale, PTO) are more commonly associated with administrative/support staff, not the technical red team workforce.

## Technology Stack

Millennium's tech stack is operator-driven and classified at the mission level. Publicly available signals:

- **k>fivefour Training Platform**: Proprietary online red team training environment with "Battlegrounds" — a 24/7 web browser-based cyber range that does not require special software installation. Indicates investment in cloud-hosted range infrastructure [8].
- **ShadowView**: Proprietary digital footprint discovery and analysis capability — an OSINT/attack surface management tool marketed to federal customers [6].
- **Custom Tooling**: The Black Ops Team explicitly develops "custom toolsets for highly complex, high-end missions" — custom C2 infrastructure, payloads, and evasion tools are part of the operator toolkit [7].
- **Inferred from operations**: DoD red team environments typically involve adversary emulation frameworks (Cobalt Strike, Brute Ratel, Nighthawk equivalents), custom implant development (C/C++, C#, Rust), and integration with NSA-mandated OPSEC and reporting standards.
- **NIWC Atlantic contract scope**: Includes information assurance, cyber defense, cyber systems security, network infrastructure, and program management — indicating the team works across both offensive and defensive capability domains [10].

## Social Media Intelligence

No significant X/Twitter presence identified for Millennium Corporation itself. LinkedIn is the primary professional channel [3]:

- Millennium Corporation LinkedIn: Active company page with job postings and occasional content on red team operations and hiring.
- The company actively recruits via LinkedIn, Glassdoor, ClearedJobs.net, and iCIMS (their ATS).
- Kevin Jennings has a LinkedIn presence [5].
- Intelligence Community News and Washington Technology cover Millennium periodically [12, 4].

**Hiring signals (2025-2026)**: Multiple red team operator roles open across Arlington, Huntsville, and Virginia Beach — consistent with NIWC Atlantic contract growth and expanding red team bench [posted positions visible on Rise, LinkedIn, and iCIMS].

## Key Insights for Interview

1. **Navy/NIWC Atlantic is the growth engine.** The $99.9M MTS Advantage IDIQ and follow-on $177M NAVSEA task order are the contracts that explain the Virginia Beach posting. Virginia Beach is the home of NIWC Atlantic. This role likely supports that contract and related naval weapon system assessments. Frame the ICS/OT live satellite exercise experience from Moonlight Defender as directly analogous to naval weapon system cyber assessment — both involve platform-centric, embedded systems in operational environments.

2. **"Largest contingent of contracted RT operators in DoD" is both a differentiator and a selling point to emphasize.** Millennium's identity is built on this claim. Joining means being part of the defining red team organization in the DoD contractor space — not a generic MSSP. Demonstrate you understand this during the interview by referencing their specific operational scale and NSA certification posture.

3. **The Markon partnership signals growth.** Being acquired into a larger "family of companies" typically means expanded BD opportunities, more diverse contracts, and potential mission breadth expansion. The role's "Business Development" support requirement ties directly to this — senior operators are expected to help win new contracts. Frame any BD or scope-expansion experience accordingly.

4. **k>fivefour is the talent development platform.** If asked about mentoring and training junior operators, reference Millennium's investment in their own training platform as evidence they take operator development seriously — and align your own experience mentoring 50+ personnel and leading CPT recertification events to their model.

5. **Custom tooling and Black Ops mission depth.** The "Black Ops Team" doing custom toolset development maps directly to Eric's exploit development, OSED certification, and adversary emulation platform work at USSF. Emphasize this capability if asked about tool development experience — it's a differentiator within Millennium's own team structure.

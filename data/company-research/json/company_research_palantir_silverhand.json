  "executive_summary": "Palantir is aggressively expanding its footprint as the primary data-infrastructure layer for the UK's most sensitive government functions. With a recent £750M MoD commitment and the controversial £330M NHS FDP contract, the company is pivoting from a US-centric 'defense tech' firm to a global provider of sovereign data mission logic. For a candidate like Johnny Silverhand, this environment demands a unique synthesis of tactical field experience and an uncompromising approach to system integrity and ethical auditing, aligning with Palantir's rejection of consumer-grade 'shallow' security models.",

# Interview Preparation: Red Team Security Engineer III at Millennium Corporation

**Date:** 2026-02-14
**Based on:** Match Assessment (Phase 1) + Company Research (Phase 2)

## Priority Areas

### Priority 1: NSA/DCRT-Compliant Red Team Leadership at Scale

**Why It Matters:** Millennium's entire identity rests on supporting 8 of 12 DoD Certified Red Teams and being the largest contracted red team in DoD. They need senior operators who understand NSA-certified operations at a process and compliance level — not just technical execution. Their MTS Advantage contract ($99.9M NIWC Atlantic) and follow-on NAVSEA task order ($177M) demand operators who can lead without constant oversight.

**Their Need:** "Serve as technical lead, mentor, and trusted advisor within NSA-certified DoD Red Team operations" and "Ensure compliance with NSA and DoD red team standards."

**Your Position:** Eric served as Technical Director for Cyber Aggressor operations at U.S. Space Force, directly establishing "policies and procedures governing aggressor operations, ensuring compliance with DoD Certified Red Team (DCRT) standards." This is the same certification framework. He also led execution for two major exercises and managed $580K in annual resources — demonstrating both operational and administrative ownership of a red team program.

**Talking Points:**
1. Cite specific experience establishing DCRT compliance at USSF — this is directly analogous to NSA RTO standards. Both govern ROE development, operational security, and reporting requirements for certified red teams.
2. Reference the progression: started as a cyber defense operator, became a branch chief leading 15-person threat emulation teams, then technical director over full aggressor programs — the career arc demonstrates readiness to serve as a technical lead with trusted advisor status, not just a skilled operator.
3. Emphasize the mission planning and executive out-brief experience: "Advise government leadership on attack paths, mission risk, and outcomes" maps directly to USSF advisory role briefing flag-level officers and interagency partners.

---

### Priority 2: ICS/OT and Platform-Centric Cyber Assessment Experience

**Why It Matters:** The NIWC Atlantic contract and Virginia Beach location strongly indicate this role supports naval weapon system cyber assessments — platform-centric, embedded systems environments analogous to ICS/OT. Millennium's listing of ICS/OT as highly desired is not generic — it maps to specific customer requirements. The "Moonlight Defender" exercises are a direct parallel: live satellite systems with on-orbit ICS/OT integration.

**Their Need:** "Experience with Long-dwell and stealth-focused operations; EDR/AV evasion; ICS/OT or platform-centric cyber assessments" (Highly Desired).

**Your Position:** Led Moonlight Defender 1 and 2, described explicitly as "the first live-satellite purple-team cyber exercises integrating on-orbit systems and ICS/OT networks." This is platform-centric cyber assessment on live operational systems — directly analogous to naval weapon system assessments. The audiences (80+ operators trained) and the organizational scale (USSF-wide exercise) demonstrate ability to operate in complex, multi-stakeholder environments.

**Talking Points:**
1. Frame the live satellite ICS/OT work as platform-centric cyber assessment experience — the underlying challenge (assessing embedded systems in operational platforms where availability is mission-critical) is the same whether the platform is a satellite or a naval combat system.
2. Emphasize that Moonlight Defender was the FIRST such exercise in Space Force history — it required designing the assessment methodology from scratch, working within operational constraints, and coordinating with system owners who had never participated in adversarial testing. This is exactly the challenge environment that NAVSEA/NIWC customers present.
3. Connect OSEP certification (advanced post-exploitation, persistence, long-dwell TTPs) and OSCE3 (advanced evasion) to the operational requirements for long-dwell stealth operations in these environments.

---

### Priority 3: Custom Tooling and Exploit Development Capability

**Why It Matters:** Millennium's "Black Ops Team" explicitly develops "custom toolsets for highly complex, high-end missions." The job posting lists "Develop and maintain custom tooling, payloads, and C2 infrastructure" as a core responsibility. This is not a capability every red team operator has — it differentiates senior engineers from operators who only deploy existing tooling. Millennium's competitive advantage in classified missions depends on custom capability development.

**Their Need:** "Develop and maintain custom tooling, payloads, and C2 infrastructure" and "Execute advanced evasion, persistence, and long-dwell operations."

**Your Position:** OSCE3 (combining OSEP + OSED + OSWE) directly demonstrates exploit development, custom payload creation, and advanced evasion. OSED specifically covers custom shellcode, buffer overflow exploitation, and bypassing modern mitigations. At USSF, Eric "developed and deployed the first Space Force cyber aggressor operations platform, standardizing capabilities and adversary emulation workflows across units" — this is tool and infrastructure development at organizational scale.

**Talking Points:**
1. OSED certification demonstrates hands-on exploit development — not theoretical knowledge. It requires building working exploits against modern mitigations (DEP, ASLR, CFG) under time pressure. This maps directly to custom payload development requirements.
2. The Space Force aggressor platform development is an organizational-level tooling achievement: built from the ground up, deployed across multiple units, and standardized workflows that didn't previously exist. That's infrastructure ownership, not just usage.
3. C/C++/C#/Python skills (listed in technical skills) directly support C2 development. Frame Python for automation/scripting, C for implant development, and C# for .NET-based tradecraft.

---

### Priority 4: Adversary Emulation Design and Threat-Informed Operations

**Why It Matters:** Millennium's business proposition is adversary emulation aligned to real threat actors — not generic pen testing. Their customers (DoD red teams) need operators who understand how to design campaigns that accurately represent nation-state and advanced persistent threat behavior. The posting explicitly lists "Design adversary emulation campaigns aligned to real-world threat actors" as a core responsibility.

**Their Need:** "Design adversary emulation campaigns aligned to real-world threat actors" and "Lead and execute complex, multi-phase red team engagements."

**Your Position:** Army Branch Chief role was specifically titled "Cyber Threat Emulation Branch" — led 15-person team executing advanced threat emulation for 22 Cyber Protection Teams. Eric "shifted the branch to full-spectrum threat emulation, increasing training throughput 40%." At USSF, developed and deployed the cyber aggressor operations platform, "standardizing capabilities and adversary emulation workflows across units." GCTI (GIAC Cyber Threat Intelligence) certification provides the CTI foundation for threat actor research underlying adversary emulation design.

**Talking Points:**
1. Threat emulation is different from generic red teaming — it requires intelligence on the specific threat actors relevant to the target organization, translating TTPs from MITRE ATT&CK or finished intelligence into operational execution. The GCTI certification and Army CTI integration experience demonstrate this capability.
2. The 22 CPT support mission at Army required designing emulation scenarios customized to the specific defensive gaps of each team — not a one-size-fits-all approach. This reflects the "multi-phase red team engagement" design skill the posting requires.
3. Moonlight Defender's scope (live satellite + ICS/OT) required designing adversary emulation scenarios for a mission environment that had no existing playbook — demonstrating capability to develop novel campaign designs for non-standard target environments.

---

### Priority 5: Senior Mentoring, Leadership, and Mission Planning

**Why It Matters:** Millennium's model depends on retaining senior operators AND developing a pipeline of junior and mid-level operators to execute the volume of NSA-certified missions across their 8 supported red teams. The posting explicitly requires mentoring, ROE development, mission planning, and executive out-briefs — these are leadership functions that distinguish a Senior/III-level engineer from an operator. Millennium's k>fivefour training investment signals organizational commitment to operator development.

**Their Need:** "Mentor entry- and mid-level operators" and "Support ROE development, mission planning, and executive out-briefs."

**Your Position:** Mentored 50+ Space Force personnel as Technical Advisor. Led 15-person teams and 22-CPT support mission as Branch Chief. Supported 2 brigade-level exercises and 6 CPT recertification events. Teaching Assistant at SANS Institute (Jul 2022–present), providing technical guidance to professionals pursuing advanced certifications in live training environments. This is the most diverse mentoring portfolio in the application.

**Talking Points:**
1. The SANS TA role is unique — it demonstrates that Eric mentors not just his own personnel but external professionals across the broader cyber community. Millennium's k>fivefour training mission aligns: they also train beyond their internal team. This signals shared values around operator development and community contribution.
2. ROE development experience from USSF: "Established policies and procedures governing aggressor operations" is ROE development at the programmatic level — not just executing within existing rules but authoring them. This is the level of maturity expected of a trusted advisor on classified missions.
3. Executive out-brief experience: Brief experience with flag-level officers and interagency stakeholders at USSF is direct preparation for the "advise government leadership" requirement at Millennium. Reference specific brief contexts if asked.

## Anticipated Questions

### Technical Questions

**Q1: Walk me through how you would design a multi-phase red team engagement for a DoD customer with no prior red team experience.**

A: Start with scope and ROE — before any technical work, establish clear authorization boundaries, reporting requirements, and escalation procedures with the customer and their ISSO/legal chain. For a first-engagement customer, I prefer phased scoping: begin with external reconnaissance and limited initial access, then expand scope as the customer's familiarity with the process builds.

Phase one is intelligence-driven: pull OSINT on the target, map their public attack surface with tooling like Shodan, passive DNS, and certificate transparency logs. Identify likely initial access vectors based on publicly observable infrastructure and relevant threat actor TTPs for their sector.

Phase two is initial access and establishment: execute the chosen access vector (phishing, exposed service, supply chain simulation), establish persistence quietly, and validate the beachhead before expanding. Use custom implants where possible to avoid signature-based detections.

Phase three is objectives-based: move toward mission objectives (data exfiltration, credential access, lateral movement to target systems) while documenting every step for the final report.

Key example: Moonlight Defender was designed this way — phased execution, live operational constraints, ICS/OT integration — but in a space systems context where the target had never undergone adversarial testing. The methodology translated directly because the fundamentals are the same.

**Q2: Describe your approach to developing custom payloads that evade modern EDR solutions.**

A: EDR evasion starts with understanding what you're evading — static signatures, behavioral heuristics, or kernel-level telemetry. The approach varies by layer.

For static evasion: custom shellcode delivery, avoiding common shellcode stub patterns, indirect syscalls to bypass userland API hooks, and payload obfuscation that survives signature scanning without encoding artifacts that themselves become signatures.

For behavioral evasion: process injection techniques that use legitimate processes with appropriate parent-child relationships, thread injection rather than process creation, and mimicking legitimate software behavior patterns (network timing, file access patterns, process lifetime).

For kernel-level telemetry: understanding what ETW providers the EDR uses, targeted disabling of specific telemetry, and operating within known EDR blind spots.

Certification basis: OSCE3 (OSED specifically) covers custom shellcode and modern exploit development with bypass techniques. OSEP covers advanced post-exploitation and EDR evasion tradecraft operationally.

**Q3: How do you approach C2 infrastructure development and operational security for a long-dwell engagement?**

A: Infrastructure compartmentalization is the foundation. I design C2 infrastructure in tiers: disposable redirectors that take all the heat, intermediate staging infrastructure that changes periodically, and the actual team server that never touches the target directly. The implant communicates only to redirectors — if they're burned, the team server is still intact.

For long-dwell specifically: beacon timing is critical. Jitter-heavy, infrequent callbacks (hours to days, not minutes) are far harder to alert on than traditional short-interval C2. Use legitimate-looking protocols (HTTPS with valid certificates, DNS, or traffic that blends with the target's known business activity).

OPSEC for the team: all infrastructure pre-staged before the engagement starts, no operational activity from attributable infrastructure, clean separation between red team tooling and personal/admin activity, and strict need-to-know on targeting information within the team.

**Q4: How do you integrate threat intelligence into an adversary emulation campaign to align with real-world threat actors?**

A: Start with the customer's threat profile — what nation-states or threat groups actually target their sector and have the capability to reach their systems. For DoD customers, this is APT actors with demonstrated targeting of defense industrial base or mission systems. For NIWC Atlantic customers, that means looking at actors with naval or maritime targeting history.

Map the relevant threat actor's TTPs to MITRE ATT&CK, then design campaign phases that replicate those TTPs at each stage: initial access method (spear phish vs. VPN exploitation vs. supply chain), persistence mechanism, lateral movement approach, and data collection/exfiltration technique.

The goal is to test whether the defender's detection and response capabilities would catch this specific threat actor's behavior — not generic attack patterns. GCTI certification and Army CTI integration experience (coordinating with Army Cyber Command on adversary emulation) provide the intelligence analysis foundation.

### Behavioral Questions

**Q5: Tell me about a time you led a complex red team engagement that required coordinating multiple teams or stakeholders.**

S: At U.S. Space Force, I led Moonlight Defender 1 and 2 — the first live-satellite purple-team cyber exercises integrating on-orbit space systems and ICS/OT networks.

T: My task was to design and execute an exercise that had never been done before: adversarially test live satellite systems in an operational environment, coordinating with satellite operations centers, ICS/OT system owners, ground station operators, and defensive teams simultaneously.

A: I worked with FFRDCs and industry partners to develop the threat scenarios, established clear ROE with system owners who had operational risk concerns about live system testing, built the adversary emulation platform to standardize execution, and integrated purple team methodology so defenders could observe and learn in real time rather than just being tested blindly.

R: Moonlight Defender became the model for future Space Force cyber exercises — training 80+ operators and establishing the capability baseline for all subsequent exercises in the command. It directly influenced NSTTC-Cyber development and is now an ongoing institutional program.

**Q6: Describe a situation where you had to develop a capability or process from scratch with no prior playbook.**

S: When I became Technical Director for Cyber Aggressor at U.S. Space Force in June 2022, there was no established Space Force cyber aggressor operations framework — no standard platform, no standardized workflows, no formal compliance structure.

T: My job was to build it: a deployable aggressor operations capability that could support training across Space Force units while maintaining compliance with DCRT standards.

A: I designed the first Space Force cyber aggressor operations platform from the ground up — establishing the technical architecture, the operational workflows, the personnel training pipeline, and the compliance documentation needed to meet DoD standards. I coordinated with Army (who had a mature model) and with FFRDCs who were supporting adjacent capability development.

R: The platform was deployed across Space Force units and became the standard. It directly enabled Moonlight Defender and subsequent exercises. The process I built is now embedded in NSTTC-Cyber operations.

**Q7: Give me an example of how you mentored a less experienced operator and what the outcome was.**

S: As Branch Chief at Army, I inherited a team that was focused primarily on traditional threat emulation against CPTs — running scenarios but not developing operators' underlying technical depth.

T: I needed to shift the branch to full-spectrum threat emulation and build technical capability within the team, not just execute scripts.

A: I established individual development plans for each team member, tied to certification tracks and hands-on lab objectives. I ran internal training sessions covering topics the team hadn't been exposed to — advanced persistence techniques, malware analysis, and CTI integration. I paired junior members with senior operators on engagements specifically so they could observe tradecraft in action, then gave them increasing responsibility.

R: Training throughput increased 40%. Multiple team members pursued and earned advanced certifications. Two junior operators who went through the program subsequently earned senior operator roles at their follow-on assignments.

### Scenario Questions

**Q8: Millennium's MTS Advantage contract supports NIWC Atlantic with red team services for naval weapon systems. If you were assigned to support a weapon system cyber assessment for a system you've never seen before, how would you approach the first 30 days?**

A: First 30 days is all intelligence and relationship-building — no operational activity.

Week 1-2: Get read-on to the system — documentation, architecture diagrams, system boundary definitions. Build a mental model of the attack surface: what components are networked, what protocols they use, where data flows between classified and unclassified segments, and what the operational constraints are (what can I test without impacting operational readiness?).

Week 2-3: Coordinate with system stakeholders — the ISSO, the system program office, and any platform operators who need to understand the test methodology and ROE. For weapon systems, operational impact management is critical. Build a relationship with the blue team if one exists.

Week 3-4: Develop the threat model and campaign plan. For naval weapon systems, the relevant threat actors are nation-states with maritime targeting history. Map their known TTPs to the system's attack surface. Identify the highest-risk pathways (e.g., supply chain interfaces, maintenance terminals, data link integrity).

This approach mirrors what I did on Moonlight Defender — the platform was entirely new, the methodology had to be developed from scratch, and the stakeholder coordination was complex. The fundamentals transfer.

**Q9: You're leading a red team engagement and your team discovers a critical zero-day in a DoD system that's actively deployed. How do you handle disclosure and mission continuation?**

A: This is a disclosure escalation scenario — it requires immediate leadership judgment.

First, pause offensive activity on that vector. Document the finding thoroughly — proof of concept, affected systems, potential impact, and how it was discovered. This creates the basis for the disclosure package.

Second, escalate to the engagement lead and customer POC immediately — within hours, not days. For a zero-day in actively deployed DoD systems, this goes up the chain: the ISSO, the system owner, and likely their cyber chain of command depending on classification and mission impact.

Third, coordinate with the customer on whether to continue the engagement using other vectors while the zero-day is under controlled disclosure. In most ROE frameworks I've operated under, the answer is yes — continue other objectives while the critical finding is being handled separately.

Fourth, prepare the disclosure report in parallel with the customer's notification requirements. For DoD zero-days, this may involve coordinating with NSA/CISA disclosure processes depending on the system.

The key principle is: the mission is to improve the customer's security posture. A zero-day disclosure IS mission success, even if it interrupts the original engagement scope.

**Q10: Millennium's leadership expects senior engineers to support business development. You're asked to support a proposal for a new red team contract. What's your contribution and how do you approach it?**

A: My contribution as a senior operator is primarily technical volume and credibility — not the business mechanics.

On the technical side: reviewing the PWS/SOO for technical accuracy (does the scope align with what red teams actually do?), drafting the technical approach sections that describe the methodology, helping identify the right certifications and qualifications to put forward in the personnel section, and reviewing staffing plans for feasibility based on operational experience.

The credibility contribution is real: having an operator with OSCE3, GXPN, and classified red team leadership experience on the proposal team signals to the evaluators that Millennium has the human capital to execute. Past performance examples from my work (appropriately cleared/referenced) strengthen the performance record.

For the Virginia Beach/NIWC market specifically: the ICS/OT and live satellite assessment experience is differentiating content in a proposal focused on naval weapon system red teaming. I can articulate that methodology in proposal language because I built it.

I've also supported planning and capability development work at USSF that involved interagency coordination — that's directly applicable to understanding customer requirements and translating them into executable technical approaches.

## Questions to Ask

### About the Role

1. **"The posting mentions supporting ROE development and mission planning as responsibilities. For the Virginia Beach position, how much of the role is direct operator execution versus planning and leadership coordination with the government customer?"**
   *(Shows understanding of the dual operator/advisor role structure; signals readiness for the leadership component, not just technical execution)*

2. **"Given Millennium's MTS Advantage contract with NIWC Atlantic, can you tell me more about the types of systems or mission environments this role would support — whether that's traditional IT, weapon systems, or ICS/OT environments?"**
   *(References specific contract research; demonstrates understanding of the Navy customer context; practical question about mission scope)*

### About the Team

3. **"How does the Virginia Beach team interact with the broader Millennium red team structure — are operators assigned regionally by contract, or is there cross-deployment across sites for different mission types?"**
   *(Signals willingness to travel 15% as required; demonstrates interest in the team structure and Millennium's operational model)*

4. **"Millennium's k>fivefour platform is an impressive investment in operator development. Do senior engineers participate in the training program as instructors, or is that a separate function?"**
   *(References company research; signals alignment with mentoring culture; the answer reveals how seriously they invest in senior operator development vs. just consumption)*

### About the Company

5. **"With the Markon Solutions partnership expanding Millennium's operational reach, how has that changed the types of missions or customers the red team is supporting — are there new domains or customer sets that weren't in scope before?"**
   *(References the Markon acquisition/partnership; demonstrates strategic awareness; signals interest in growth and mission breadth)*

6. **"Millennium talks about supporting 8 of 12 DoD Certified Red Teams. What's the pathway for operators joining the Virginia Beach team to contribute to NSA certification maintenance — is that handled at the corporate level or are individual operators involved in the certification process?"**
   *(Demonstrates specific knowledge of Millennium's core value proposition; signals seriousness about operating within the NSA-certified framework rather than just the general red team space)*

7. **"From a career development standpoint, how does Millennium think about growth for senior engineers at the III level — is the natural progression toward program management, or does the company have pathways for staying on the technical track at a higher level?"**
   *(Practical question about career fit; shows long-term interest, not just job-hopping; important for making the relocation decision)*

## Quick Reference Card

**Top 3 Strengths to Emphasize:**

1. **DCRT-compliant red team leadership** — Established DCRT compliance at Space Force, led classified aggressor programs at operational scale. Millennium's business model depends on NSA-certified operators who can run programs, not just execute missions. Lead with this.

2. **ICS/OT + platform-centric experience via Moonlight Defender** — Live satellite ICS/OT adversarial exercise. Directly maps to NIWC Atlantic weapon system assessment requirements. Be specific: on-orbit systems, live operational environment, methodology built from scratch.

3. **Certification depth + exploit development capability** — OSCE3 (OSEP + OSED + OSWE), GXPN, GCPN, GREM. Not a pen tester who studied for certs — an operator who built custom platforms, developed exploits, and mentored others. Let OSCE3 be the anchor.

**Top 3 Gaps to Address Proactively:**

1. **NSA RTO qualification** — Frame it: "I've operated within DCRT-compliant frameworks and hold the technical certifications that underpin RTO-level tradecraft. If NSA RTO is a near-term requirement for this role, I'm committed to pursuing it — I'd like to understand the timeline and support Millennium provides for that qualification." (If you've already started or completed the process, say so explicitly.)

2. **NAVSEA/Navy weapon systems** — Frame it: "I don't have direct NAVSEA customer experience, but Moonlight Defender is the closest civilian parallel I can point to — live platform testing on on-orbit systems with ICS/OT integration, operational constraints, and multi-stakeholder coordination. The methodology translates. I'd welcome the opportunity to learn the naval weapon system specifics." Do not overclaim.

3. **Relocation to Virginia Beach** — Frame it simply: "I'm ready to relocate. My background is military — I've moved for mission throughout my career. Virginia Beach is a strong community for cleared professionals and I've already researched the area. This is not an obstacle."

**Company-Specific Hooks (Reference in Interview):**

- Moonlight Defender ↔ NIWC Atlantic weapon system assessments: both are platform-centric, live-system, ICS/OT-adjacent adversarial testing
- DCRT compliance ↔ Millennium's NSA-certified red team identity
- k>fivefour investment ↔ SANS TA role: both show commitment to operator development beyond the operator's own team
- Markon Solutions partnership ↔ Business development requirement: growing organization needs operators who can articulate mission to customers
- MTS Advantage $99.9M NIWC contract ↔ Virginia Beach posting: the contract IS the reason for the role's location

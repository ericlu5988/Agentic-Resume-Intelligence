## Strengths

- **Clearance exceeds requirement.** Resume shows Active TS/SCI with Polygraph — the posting requires TS/SCI. The poly upgrade is a competitive differentiator that expedites onboarding and opens access to more sensitive missions.
- **OSCP requirement met; certifications far exceed the bar.** OSCP is required. Eric holds OSCP, OSEP, OSCE3, GXPN, OSED, GCPN, GREM, and GRTP — among others. OSCE3 (the combination of OSEP + OSED + OSWE) is one of the most respected advanced certifications in the field and directly maps to the role's evasion, exploit development, and long-dwell requirements.
- **8+ years of directly qualifying experience in OCO and NSA/DCRT-compliant red teaming.** From Cyber Network Defense Manager (Jul 2017) through USSF Technical Advisor (Jan 2025–present), the career spans the exact domain. Roles as Branch Chief (Cyber Threat Emulation) and Technical Director (Cyber Aggressor) are senior classified operator positions — exactly what the posting demands.
- **NSA/DoD red team compliance demonstrated.** Resume explicitly references "DoD Certified Red Team (DCRT) standards" — directly matching the posting's requirement for NSA-certified DoD Red Team operations.
- **ICS/OT experience is real and documented.** Led Moonlight Defender 1 and 2, described as "the first live-satellite purple-team cyber exercises integrating on-orbit systems and ICS/OT networks." This maps precisely to the highly desired ICS/OT and platform-centric cyber assessment experience.
- **Long-dwell, EDR/AV evasion expertise.** OSEP and OSCE3 directly address advanced persistence and defense evasion. Adversary emulation workflows built across Army and Space Force demonstrate operational application.
- **Senior leadership and mentoring background.** Led 15-person teams (Army), directed $580K in annual resources (USSF), mentored 50+ personnel. The posting explicitly requires mentoring entry- and mid-level operators — this is a strong match.
- **Executive briefing and technical writing.** USSF Technical Advisor role ("advise government leadership," "executive out-briefs") maps directly to the posting's requirement to "advise government leadership on attack paths, mission risk, and outcomes."
- **Graduate degree.** MS Computer Science, Georgia Tech (GPA 4.0). Exceeds the BS degree requirement and signals strong technical depth.

## Gaps

- **NSA Red Team Operator (RTO) qualification not documented.** The posting lists NSA RTO as highly desired. While DCRT compliance is documented and Eric has operated in NSA-aligned environments, the specific NSA RTO qualification is not listed on the resume. Address in cover letter by emphasizing DCRT compliance and classified red team leadership. If the qualification exists, add it to the resume explicitly.
- **NAVSEA / US Navy / weapon system cyber assessment not documented.** This is a highly desired qualification. The Moonlight Defender satellite ICS/OT work provides a credible bridge — space systems cyber assessments on live on-orbit platforms share design and security parallels with naval weapon systems. Frame it this way in interviews. Do not claim direct NAVSEA experience.
- **CRTO certification not held.** Listed as one of the highly desired certs. CRTO (Certified Red Team Operator, Zero-Point Security) is a common commercial RT cert. Eric holds OSCP, OSEP, OSCE3, and GXPN — all of which are objectively more rigorous. This is not a gap in skill, only in specific credential; mention the broader cert portfolio and let OSCE3 speak for itself.
- **Virginia Beach relocation required.** Resume shows Colorado Springs, CO. Virginia Beach is the duty location. This is not a disqualifier — DoD contractor roles routinely relocate cleared professionals — but proactively address availability and openness to relocation in application materials.

## Red Flags Checked

- **Certification gap:** CLEAR — OSCP held (required); OSEP and GXPN meet "highly desired" list; OSCE3 exceeds industry expectations for senior RT roles.
- **Experience gap:** CLEAR — ~8-9 years of qualifying OCO and NSA/DoD red team experience. Meets the 8-year minimum with appropriate seniority progression.
- **Tech stack mismatch:** CLEAR — Full overlap on offensive operations (adversary emulation, C2 infrastructure, exploit development, evasion), ICS/OT, and DoD mission environments.
- **Location conflict:** NOTED (not auto-NO-GO) — Virginia Beach vs. Colorado Springs. Relocation will be necessary. Flag this in application and be prepared to address during screening.

## Recommendation

This is a strong match. Eric's profile is competitive for this role. The combination of TS/SCI with Poly, DCRT-compliant red team leadership, live ICS/OT cyber exercise experience (Moonlight Defender), and an elite certification stack (OSCE3, OSEP, GXPN) positions this application well above the average applicant.

The two gaps worth addressing are: (1) NSA RTO qualification — clarify in cover letter whether this has been earned or is in progress, and add to resume if applicable; and (2) the NAVSEA/Navy weapon system experience — bridge this gap with the space system and ICS/OT narrative.

Proceed to Phase 2 (Company Research) and full application preparation. Priority emphasis areas: DCRT compliance experience, ICS/OT red team (Moonlight Defender), executive advising capability, and certification depth.

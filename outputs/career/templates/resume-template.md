## ATS Compliance Standards (MANDATORY)

### Format Requirements

| Requirement | Standard |
|-------------|----------|
| File format | `.docx` preferred for ATS, `.md` for drafting |
| Font | Arial, Calibri, or Times New Roman |
| Font size | 10-12pt body, 14-16pt headings |
| Layout | Single column only (no tables, text boxes, or graphics) |
| Margins | 0.5-1 inch |
| Length | 1-2 pages maximum |
| Contact info | In body text, NOT in header/footer |

### Prohibited Elements

- **No emojis or icons** (checkmarks, stars, bullets like ★ ● ◆)
- **No tables or columns** (ATS scrambles multi-column layouts)
- **No graphics, logos, or images**
- **No headers/footers** (ATS often skips these)
- **No text boxes**
- **No fancy bullet characters** (use simple hyphens or standard bullets)

### Prohibited Language

**AI Clichés to AVOID:**
- "Leverage/leveraged"
- "Dynamic"
- "Passionate"
- "Proven track record"
- "Results-driven"
- "Synergy/synergize"
- "Game-changer"
- "Cutting-edge"
- "Think outside the box"
- "Go-getter"
- "Self-starter"
- "Detail-oriented" (unless demonstrating HOW)

**Instead, use:** Specific, quantifiable achievements with action verbs.

## Resume Structure (Reverse Chronological)

**CRITICAL: Most recent experience FIRST, oldest LAST.**

**BEFORE writing resume:**
1. Extract ALL positions from source resume with their dates
2. Sort by end date: Most recent first, oldest last
3. Write in sorted order - do NOT preserve source order if incorrect

**Verification:** First position must have most recent end date, last position must have oldest end date.

## Keyword Optimization

### Rules

1. **Match job description language exactly** - If they say "Kubernetes," don't write "K8s" only
2. **Include both acronym AND full form** - "Amazon Web Services (AWS)" on first use
3. **Use skills section strategically** - Mirror keywords from job posting
4. **Don't keyword stuff** - Must read naturally to human reviewers

### Example

**Job Description says:** "Experience with Enterprise Resource Planning systems"

**Resume should include:** "Implemented Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems including SAP and Oracle"

---

## Achievement Bullet Formula

**Structure:** [Action Verb] + [What You Did] + [How/With What] + [Result/Impact]

### Strong Examples

- "Reduced security incident response time by 40% by implementing automated detection and triage workflows"
- "Led migration of 200+ applications to AWS, completing 3 months ahead of schedule with zero downtime"
- "Managed $2.5M annual security budget, achieving 15% cost reduction through vendor consolidation"

### Weak Examples (Avoid)

- "Responsible for security" (no action, no result)
- "Worked on cloud migration" (vague, no impact)
- "Helped with budget management" (passive, no specifics)

---

## Date Formatting

**Consistent format required. Choose ONE:**

- `January 2020 - Present`
- `Jan 2020 - Present`
- `01/2020 - Present`

**Never mix formats within the same resume.**

---

## ATS Self-Test

Before finalizing:

1. Copy resume text into plain text editor (Notepad)
2. If content appears clean and in order: PASS
3. If content is scrambled or missing: FAIL - reformat
